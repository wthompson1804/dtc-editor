# HEDGING IN TECHNICAL WRITING
#
# IMPORTANT: Some hedging is NECESSARY and APPROPRIATE in technical writing:
# - "approximately" for imprecise measurements
# - "may" / "might" for genuine possibilities
# - "should" for expected behavior
# - "typically" / "generally" for patterns
# - "we believe" with supporting evidence
#
# This rule only flags WEAK hedging that adds nothing:
# - Informal qualifiers ("kind of", "sort of")
# - Excessive stacking of hedges
# - Weasel attributions without specifics

tokens:
  # === INFORMAL/CONVERSATIONAL HEDGING ===
  # These are always too casual for technical writing
  - "kind of"
  - "sort of"
  - "a bit"
  - "a little"
  - "like maybe"
  - "just maybe"
  - "pretty much"
  - "more or less"
  - "in a way"
  - "in a sense"
  - "for the most part"

  # === DOUBLE/STACKED HEDGING ===
  # Over-hedging weakens claims unnecessarily
  - "could possibly"
  - "might possibly"
  - "may possibly"
  - "quite possibly"
  - "it is possible that it may"
  - "may or may not"
  - "could potentially"
  - "might potentially"

  # === WEASEL ATTRIBUTIONS ===
  # Vague attributions that should be specific or removed
  - "it could be argued"
  - "it could be said"
  - "one might argue"
  - "one might say"
  - "some might say"
  - "some would argue"
  - "it has been argued"
  - "it has been suggested"

  # === UNNECESSARY QUALIFIERS ===
  # These often add no information
  - "to a certain extent"
  - "to a large extent"
  - "up to a point"
  - "I think that"
  - "I feel that"
  - "I believe that"

  # Note: "we believe", "we think", "it seems", "appears to", "may", "might"
  # are deliberately NOT included - these are appropriate in technical writing
  # when expressing genuine uncertainty or preliminary conclusions
