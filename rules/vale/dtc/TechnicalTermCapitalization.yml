# AP Style: Technical Term Capitalization
#
# RULE: Generic terms of art are NOT capitalized per AP style.
# These terms are technical vocabulary, not formal names of companies,
# programs, or publications.
#
# EXCEPTION: Capitalize when part of a formal name (e.g., "Virtual Power
# Plant Association" - but this requires LLM context awareness).
#
# ACRONYM FORMAT: When introducing an acronym, use lowercase term with
# capitalized acronym in parentheses: "virtual power plant (VPP)"
#
# NOTE: This rule lowercases over-capitalized terms. Authors frequently
# capitalize every technical term, which violates AP style. These fixes
# should be flagged for LLM review when context is ambiguous.
