# WEAK LANGUAGE IN TECHNICAL WRITING
#
# IMPORTANT: Many "weak" words are perfectly appropriate in technical writing:
# - "generally", "typically", "usually" - appropriate for patterns
# - "significantly" - appropriate for statistical significance
# - "often" - legitimate for frequency
# - "primarily", "mainly" - appropriate for emphasis
# - "probably", "possibly" - appropriate for uncertainty
# - "relatively" - appropriate for comparisons
#
# This rule only flags words that are TYPICALLY meaningless filler,
# especially when used as intensifiers. Level is "suggestion" because
# context determines appropriateness.

  - "absolutely"
  - "entirely"
  - "extremely"
  - "incredibly"

  - "just"
  - "quite"
  - "rather"

  # === PRESUMPTUOUS WORDS ===
  # Can be condescending to readers
  - "obviously"
  - "clearly"
  - "simply"
  - "easily"
  - "naturally"
  - "of course"
  - "undoubtedly"
  - "surely"
  - "certainly"

  # === INFORMAL DISCOURSE MARKERS ===
  # Too casual for formal technical writing
  - "frankly"
  - "honestly"

  - "hopefully"

  # Note: "generally", "typically", "usually", "primarily", "mainly",

  # "perhaps", "normally" are deliberately NOT included - these are
  # appropriate in technical writing for precise qualification.
