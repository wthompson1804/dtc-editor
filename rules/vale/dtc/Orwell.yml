# ORWELL'S PRINCIPLES FOR CLEAR PROSE
# From "Politics and the English Language" (1946)
#
# Rule 1: Never use a dead metaphor, simile, or figure of speech
# Rule 3: If it is possible to cut a word out, always cut it out
# Rule 5: Never use jargon if you can think of an everyday equivalent
#         (BUT: Technical terms of art are preserved - they ARE the precise term)
#
# This rule catches patterns that are universally problematic in ANY writing,
# including technical documents. These are never necessary.

tokens:
  # === DEAD METAPHORS (Rule 1) ===

  - '(?i)^it should be (noted|mentioned|emphasized|stressed) that'
  - '(?i)^it is worth (noting|mentioning|pointing out) that'

  - '(?i)^it seems (to be )?that'
  - '(?i)^in this day and age'
  - '(?i)^in today.s (world|society|environment)'

  # === EMPTY INTENSIFIERS ===

  - 'many (say|argue|believe|feel)'
  - 'experts (say|agree|believe)'

  - 'studies (show|suggest|indicate)'

  # Only flag these when they're truly vague (no citation follows)
  # Technical writing properly uses these with citations
