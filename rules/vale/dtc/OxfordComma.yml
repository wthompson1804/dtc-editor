# DTC Style Guide: Oxford Comma
# Rule: Use the Oxford comma in lists (A, B, and C)
extends: existence
message: "Missing Oxford comma: '%s' - consider 'A, B, and C' format."
level: warning
ignorecase: true

# This pattern catches "A, B and C" without the Oxford comma
# It looks for: word, word and word (missing comma before "and")
tokens:
  # Basic pattern: "X, Y and Z" without comma before "and"
  - '\b\w+,\s+\w+\s+and\s+\w+\b'
  # Also catch "X, Y or Z" for consistency
  - '\b\w+,\s+\w+\s+or\s+\w+\b'
