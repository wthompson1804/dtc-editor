# DTC Style: Organization Name Protection
#
# RULE: Formal organization names must remain properly capitalized.
# These are NOT generic terms - they are proper nouns (company names,
# regulatory bodies, industry consortia, standards organizations).
#
# This rule RE-CAPITALIZES organization names that may have been
# incorrectly lowercased by other rules or manual edits.
#
# NOTE: This rule should be processed AFTER TechnicalTermCapitalization
# to override any accidental lowercasing of organization names.
