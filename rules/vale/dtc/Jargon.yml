# JARGON IN TECHNICAL WRITING
#
# IMPORTANT: Many "business terms" are legitimate in technical writing:
# - "ecosystem" - legitimate (software ecosystem, IoT ecosystem)
# - "scalable" - legitimate technical term
# - "robust" - legitimate technical term
# - "enable" - standard technical term
# - "optimize" - legitimate technical term
# - "leverage" - can be legitimate in technical contexts
# - "stakeholder" - legitimate project management term
# - "granular" - legitimate technical term for fine-grained
# - "onboarding" - industry standard term
#
# This rule only flags EMPTY business buzzwords that rarely add meaning
# and can almost always be replaced with clearer alternatives.
# Level is "suggestion" because some may be appropriate in context.
