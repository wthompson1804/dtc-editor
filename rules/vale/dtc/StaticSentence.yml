# STATIC SENTENCES: Be-verb + adjective/noun without action

# "The system is capable of processing data" → "The system processes data"
# "The architecture is supportive of scaling" → "The architecture supports scaling"
#
# Be-verbs (is, are, was, were) state existence, not action.
# Sentences built only on be-verbs feel static and lifeless.
