# VIGOR: Patterns that drain life from prose
#
# This rule targets constructions that, while grammatically correct,
# make prose feel bureaucratic, distant, or sleep-inducing.
#
# The goal is not "plain language" (which can be dull) but VIGOROUS language
# that moves, that has actors doing things, that engages the reader.

# sentence to its cleanest components."
