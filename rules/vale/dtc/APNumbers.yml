# This catches standalone single digits (2-9) that should be spelled out
# Note: "1" is excluded as "one" vs "1" is often ambiguous in context
# Excludes: ranges (5-10), percentages (5%), times (5 p.m.), measurements
tokens:
  # Standalone digits 2-9 not in special contexts
  # Negative lookbehind: not preceded by digit, hyphen, or decimal
  # Negative lookahead: not followed by digit, hyphen, percent, colon (time), or units
