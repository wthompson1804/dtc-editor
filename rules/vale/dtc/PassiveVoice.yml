# PASSIVE VOICE IN TECHNICAL WRITING
#
# IMPORTANT: Passive voice is STANDARD and APPROPRIATE in technical writing:
# - Methods sections: "The data was collected..."
# - Specifications: "The system shall be configured..."
# - Objective reporting: "The results were analyzed..."
# - Unknown/unimportant actors: "The bug was discovered in version 2.0"
#
# Per IEEE and ISO standards, passive voice is acceptable when:
# - The action is more important than the actor
# - The actor is unknown or irrelevant
# - Objectivity is required (scientific writing)
#
# This rule only flags PROBLEMATIC passive patterns where:
# - The passive obscures responsibility
# - The passive adds unnecessary wordiness
# - The sentence could be clearer with active voice
#
# Level is "suggestion" because technical writing often legitimately uses passive.

tokens:
  # === PASSIVE THAT OBSCURES RESPONSIBILITY ===
  # These often hide who should be accountable
  - "mistakes were made"
  - "errors were introduced"
  - "problems were caused"
  - "issues were created"
  - "bugs were introduced"
  - "faults were found"
  - "failures were detected"

  # === WORDY PASSIVE CONSTRUCTIONS ===
  # These can almost always be shortened
  - "it is believed that"
  - "it is thought that"
  - "it is assumed that"
  - "it is expected that"
  - "it is recommended that"
  - "it is suggested that"
  - "it is required that"
  - "it is necessary that"
  - "it is important that"
  - "it is essential that"
  - "it has been determined that"
  - "it has been decided that"
  - "it has been found that"
  - "it has been shown that"
  - "it has been demonstrated that"
  - "it has been established that"
  - "it has been observed that"
  - "it has been noted that"
  - "it was determined that"
  - "it was decided that"
  - "it was found that"
  - "it can be seen that"
  - "it should be noted that"
  - "it must be emphasized that"
  - "it is worth noting that"
  - "it is interesting to note that"
  - "it is to be noted that"

  # === UNNECESSARY PASSIVE HEDGES ===
  # Often weaken statements without adding meaning
  - "is considered to be"
  - "is said to be"
  - "is known to be"
  - "is thought to be"
  - "is believed to be"
  - "is understood to be"
  - "is felt to be"
  - "is reported to be"
  - "is claimed to be"

  # Note: Simple passive constructions like "was measured", "was calculated",
  # "was designed", "was implemented", etc. are deliberately NOT included
  # because they are standard and appropriate in technical documentation.
