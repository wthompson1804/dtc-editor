# ABSTRACT/EXPLETIVE SENTENCE STARTERS
#
# "It is important that we..." → "We must..."
# "There are many factors that..." → "Many factors..."
# "This is a system that..." → "This system..."
#
# These constructions delay the real subject and actor, making prose feel
# distant and impersonal. They're grammatically correct but often weak.
#
# Strunk & White: "Use the active voice... Place the emphatic words at the end"
# But first, you need a real subject at the beginning.
